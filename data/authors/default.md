Hi! I am Richard!

I am from Reunion Island and currently based in Aubenas, in France. I am your typical introvert, socially awkward, wanna-be geek, who spends way too much time behind my laptop.

I discovered programming in 2018 through a website called <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>, and as soon as I completed my first landing page project, I was hooked!

In 2019, I registered for <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon</a> in Bali, Indonesia, a reputed coding Bootcamp, and in 2020, I obtained a BSc in Web Development from <a href="https://en.unistra.fr/"> the University Of Strasbourg</a>, in France.

Currently, I am sharpening my tool kit and learning about this ancient language called PHP ,and I am really excited by this. I am also planning to extend my knowledge of Linux and Information Security in the future.

When I am not brainstorming back-end applications or designing websites, I love to spend my time Freediving in the most beautiful destinations on the planet.
