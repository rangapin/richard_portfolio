Hi, I am Richard!

I am from France. I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Web Development from the University of Strasbourg. I love working with technologies such as PHP, WordPress and Laravel.

When I am not designing websites or brainstorming back-end applications, I like to spend time Freediving around the
most beautiful destinations on the planet!

Let’s connect!
