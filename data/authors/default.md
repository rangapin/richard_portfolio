Hi there! I’m Richard.

I am French and currently based in Nicaragua. I’m a passionate introvert who spends too much time behind my laptop.

I discovered programming in 2018 through a website called <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>, and as soon as I finished building the first project, I was hooked.

After several months of learning basic programming, I decided to change my career and pursue software engineering. In 2019, I registered for <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon</a> in Bali, Indonesia, a reputed coding Bootcamp, and in 2020, I obtained a BSc in Web Development from the <a href="https://en.unistra.fr/">University Of Strasbourg</a>, in France.

Currently, I am sharpening my tool kit and learning about this ancient language called PHP, and I am excited to see what I can build with it.

When I am not brainstorming back-end applications or designing websites, I love to spend my time Freediving in the most beautiful destinations on the planet.

Let’s connect and dive into your next project!
