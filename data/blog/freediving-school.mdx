## Objective

The main objective of this project was to make accessible various content materials for students of a Freediving School.

The idea was to compiled key points and video demonstrations of Freediving Skills taught at the school as a way to make
the content easily available for students and instructors alike.

## Approach

This project was fun and I wanted it to be educational for the mostly. The accent here is on functionality and not so much on design.

The users wanted the application to be fast and responsive.

I started by researching the content, and opted to make sure it was going to be filterable. I looked up on relevant
sites and copied the video URL from Youtube.

I then decided to opt for a template available on Vercel for this project. I wanted to have the opportunity to use new technologies and also to be able to deploy easily.

The actual template is available here:

## Project duration

The project duration was 24 hours. Most of my time was spent searching for the relevant content and filtering it.

## My role

I basically build this project from 'almost' scratch.
