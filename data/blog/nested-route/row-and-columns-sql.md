## What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data stored in relational databases. It is a standard language for accessing and manipulating data in relational database management systems (RDBMS).

SQL allows you to create, modify, and delete databases and tables, as well as insert, update, and delete data stored in them.

## A column

In a database table, a column is a set of data values of a particular type, such as a list of names, a list of ages, or a list of email addresses. Each column has a unique name and contains a specific type of data, such as integers, dates, or strings.

## A row

A row, on the other hand, is a single record in a table. It represents a unique instance of the data in the table, with one value for each column. For example, in a table that stores information about users, each row would represent a single user and would contain values for columns such as name, age, and email address.

## Summary

So, to summarize: a column is a set of values of a specific data type in a table, while a row is a single record in a table, consisting of a unique set of values for each column.
